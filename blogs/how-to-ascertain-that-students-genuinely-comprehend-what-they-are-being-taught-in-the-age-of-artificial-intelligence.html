    <p>No doubt, we are currently living in an era profoundly influenced by Artificial Intelligence (AI), a time when machines can compose essays, solve mathematical equations, generate research summaries, and even simulate human reasoning. Yet, beneath this technological brilliance lies a pedagogical dilemma: How can educators be certain that students truly understand what they are being taught, rather than merely reproducing answers generated by chatbots?</p>
    
    <p>Authentic education transcends the act of getting things right; it is about knowing how and why things work. The real essence of learning is the cultivation of understanding, reasoning, and intellectual autonomy and not the passive regurgitation of pre-formulated responses. The below is a list of thoughts for educators to consider.</p>
    
    <div class="steps">
      
      <div class="step">
        <h3>Learning to learn</h3>
        <p>The genuine purpose of education is to learn, unlearn, and relearn; to master the art of inquiry and problem-solving. Unfortunately, in the AI-driven generation, students often equate success with the ability to produce correct answers. But correctness, devoid of comprehension, is a hollow victory. Educators must therefore redirect emphasis from accuracy to insight and also encourage students to explore the mechanisms behind every concept.</p>
        
        <p>For instance, when students solve a simultaneous equation such as:</p>
        
        <p>2x + 3y = 12 and x - y = 1,</p>
        
        <p>many students may plug these into an AI app and get x = 3, y = 2. But only a few understand why substitution or elimination works. A teacher who pauses to ask, "Why does subtracting one equation from another help us eliminate a variable?" pushes learners from surface correctness to genuine reasoning.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="step">
        <h3>Anchor Learning in the Students Physical and Social Environment</h3>
        <p>Education should never be detached from the learner's immediate world. For example, instead of defining acceleration as a change in velocity over time, a teacher can ask: "When a keke napep (tricycle) suddenly speeds up to overtake, what do you feel? How does that relate to acceleration?" Similarly, in teaching percentages, the teacher might use a local market setting: "If a bag of garri increases from ₦25,000 to ₦30,000, what is the percentage increase?"</p>
        
        <p>When concepts are abstracted beyond recognition, comprehension diminishes. Hence, teachers must situate learning within tangible, observable realities.</p>
      </div>
                 
      <div class="step">
        <h3>Discern Understanding through Students Language and Expression</h3>
        <p>A better indicator of comprehension lies in how students talk about what they have learned. When learners can explain a concept fluently in their own words using original analogies and local experiences, it signifies true understanding.</p>
        
        <p>For example, if a student says: "Interest rate is like when my mother borrows ₦100,000 from a cooperative and must return ₦110,000 after some months, that extra ₦10,000 is the interest," such explanation shows both understanding and contextual reasoning.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="step">
        <h3>Prioritize In-Class Intellectual Engagement Over Take-Home Assignments</h3>
        <p>Reliability of homework as a measure of understanding is diminishing since take-home tasks are increasingly vulnerable to automation. Instead, in-class problem-solving should take precedence.</p>
      </div>
                 
      <div class="step">
        <h3>Employ Diagrams, Concept Maps, and Visual Analogies</h3>
        <p>The cognitive power of visualization cannot be overstated. In an era of short attention spans, diagrams and conceptual maps help bridge the gap between abstraction and understanding. Encouraging students to sketch their own visual interpretations, whether mind maps of geometry or graphs of quadratic functions, helps transform them from passive receivers to active thinkers.</p>
        
        <figure>
          <img src="/images/cassava_yield.png" alt="Illustrating the graph of y = x^2" class="article-image">
        </figure>
      </div>
                 
      <div class="step">
        <h3>Diagnose Understanding, Not Just Deliver Content</h3>
        <p>In this age of AI, the teacher role has evolved from information provider to understanding diagnostician. The challenge is not to teach more, but to ensure that what is taught is deeply understood.</p>
        
        <p>Instead of asking, "Differentiate y = x²," a teacher could say, "Assume you're tracking the growth of cassava yield on a farm, modeled by y = x², where x represents years. What does the derivative represent in this context?" Such contextualization turns calculus into comprehension.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="conclusion">
      <h2 class="section-title">To Conclude</h2>
      <p>Whether we are yet ready or not for it, AI has come to stay. As educators, we must therefore rekindle the spirit of inquiry, cultivating in our students the ability to think, question, and reason independently of algorithms. Intelligence is not in using technology to find answers, but in possessing the intellectual courage to seek understanding beyond technology.</p>
