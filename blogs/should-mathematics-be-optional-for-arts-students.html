      <p class="subtitle">The Unintended Consequences of Nigeria's New Education Policy</p>
      <div class="reading-time" id="readingTime">

      </div>
    </div>

    <p>For days now, I have been thinking about how to approach this matter without sounding biased to my readers, especially since all of my degrees are in Mathematics. That being said, concealing the truth due to a fear of appearing prejudiced is also a dangerous path.</p>

    <p>We may have stumbled either on the news, web blogs, Whatsapp, Facebook, or other social media platforms on the recent announcement by the Federal Ministry of Education regarding the removal of Mathematics as a compulsory admission requirement for Arts and Humanities students which has stirred both excitement and concern across Nigeria's education community. For some, the decision feels like a breath of fresh air, a long overdue relief for students who have historically struggled with numbers. But for others, especially teachers and policy observers, this change may have unintended consequences that might ripple far beyond tertiary admission policies.</p>

    <p>At the heart of the issue lies a simple truth: Major examination bodies in Nigeria use a standardized grading system. For instance, under the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) and National Examination Council (NECO), the grades range from A1, which is excellent, to F9, which is a fail, with anything from A1 to C6 considered a credit pass. In reality, most students who aspire to study Arts or Humanities courses at the university level do not need an A1 in Mathematics; a C6 is often enough.</p>

    <p>So my question is: why is it really necessary to exclude Mathematics entirely from the list of required subjects for admission into Arts and Humanities programmes?</p>

    <p>When we examine the implications closely, this exclusion might do more harm than good. For one, the decision risks creating a mindset among secondary school students that Mathematics no longer matters. If students are told early in their academic journey that they can succeed without ever passing Mathematics, many might lose interest in the subject altogether. I saw this principle at work back in my days at Hope Foundation Secondary School. Because we all knew we had to achieve a credit in Maths in WAEC or NECO, everyone put in the necessary effort. This universal requirement ensured that even Arts students, who may have been aiming for just a pass, were still engaged with the subject, while those in Science strove for higher grades. This engagement is vital because the processes of learning Mathematics itself shapes how students think, reason, and solve problems. It teaches logic, precision, and analytical thinking, which are qualities that are just as valuable in the Arts as they are in Science.</p>

    <p>A more balanced policy could have achieved the government's goal without sacrificing the subject's importance. Instead of completely removing Mathematics from the admission criteria, the Ministry could have simply lowered the benchmark, perhaps allowing a D7, a pass but below credit level, for Arts and Humanities students. This would acknowledge that not every student will excel in Mathematics while still preserving the subject's relevance in secondary education.</p>

    <div class="policy-note">
      <p><strong>Ministry Clarification:</strong> The government has reaffirmed that all students must still register for and sit English and Mathematics at the O'Level. This ensures that every Nigerian student still encounters Mathematics as part of their educational journey, even if the final grade no longer determines university eligibility for certain courses.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Furthermore, Nigeria's education system must be careful not to reinforce the dangerous divide between Arts people and Science people. In today's world, the boundaries between disciplines are increasingly blurred. Artists use algorithms in digital design, journalists rely on data visualization, and economists blend creative storytelling with mathematical modelling. The future belongs to those who can think both creatively and logically, and that means a core logical subject like Mathematics should not be treated as disposable, especially at the basic level.</p>

    <p>It is also worth noting that the Ministry's recent clarification shows some awareness of this concern. But even with this clarification, the psychological message of the initial announcement may linger: that Mathematics is optional, or even irrelevant, for some categories of students.</p>

    <div class="conclusion">
      <h2 class="section-title">The Way Forward</h2>
      <p>Education policy should aim not only to widen access but also to inspire excellence. True reform does not mean lowering expectations; it means providing better support for students to meet them. If many students are struggling with Mathematics, the solution is not to remove the subject from their path, but to rethink how it is taught, to make it less intimidating and more connected to real life applications.</p>

      <p>Nigeria must resist the temptation of easy fixes in education. The goal should be to cultivate well rounded graduates, not narrowly trained ones. And that begins with ensuring that every student, whether studying Law, Literature, or Fine Art, has at least a basic appreciation for Mathematics, the universal language of reasoning and structure.</p>
