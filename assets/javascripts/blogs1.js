    title: "When AI and Quantum Computing Meet Blockchain Security",
    date: "January 27, 2026",
    description:
      "For a long time, blockchain has been celebrated as one of the most secure digital innovations of our era. Its promise rests on strong cryptography, decentralization, and incentive driven consensus mechanisms that make tampering extremely difficult. As someone who follows developments in blockchain and emerging technologies closely, I find it increasingly clear that this sense of long term security deserves a more careful re-examination. Two rapidly advancing fields, artificial intelligence and quantum computing, are beginning to challenge some of the core assumptions on which modern blockchains are built. ...",

    title: "Automation Is Coming - Are We Ready?",
    date: "December 2, 2025",
    description:
      "At this point, it is time we quit the debate of whether AI is better at reasoning or solving problems than human beings or vice versa. No single human currently can outperform the technology generally, except for some very specific and deep areas not fed to it yet. Most people, especially the young folks, now rely on AI chatbots to do even the littlest things like generating a birthday wish, new month messages, love texts, and so on. Then at the workplace, chatbots are the new letter-writing tools. The so-called Gen Z, and even people from previous generations who are aware of the technology, no longer ...",

    title: "How to Ascertain That Students Genuinely Comprehend What They Are Being Taught in the Age of Artificial Intelligence?",
    date: "November 8, 2025",
    description:
      "No doubt, we are currently living in an era profoundly influenced by Artificial Intelligence (AI), a time when machines can compose essays, solve mathematical equations, generate research summaries, and even simulate human reasoning. Yet, beneath this technological brilliance lies a pedagogical dilemma: How can educators be certain that students truly understand what they are being taught, rather than merely reproducing answers generated by chatbots?",

    title: "Should Mathematics Be Optional for Arts Students?",
    date: "October 20, 2025",
    description:
      "For days now, I have been thinking about how to approach this matter without sounding biased to my readers, especially since all of my degrees are in Mathematics. That being said, concealing the truth due to a fear of appearing prejudiced is also a dangerous path. We may have stumbled either on the news, web blogs, Whatsapp, Facebook, or other social media platforms on the recent announcement by the Federal Ministry of Education regarding the removal of Mathematics as a compulsory admission requirement for Arts and Humanities students which has stirred both excitement and concern across Nigeria’s education community. For some...",

    title: "Nigeria at 65: A New Path to Sustainability Powered by AI",
    date: "October 1, 2025",
    description:
      "Nigeria stands at a pivotal moment in its history. As a nation teeming with vibrant human capital and abundant natural resources, the quest for sustainable development is more urgent than ever. The challenges are well-known: a volatile economy, an agricultural sector yearning for modernization, an educational system in need of reinvention, and the profound environmental and economic paradox of its crude oil wealth. Layer onto this the escalating threats of climate change, seen in devastating annual floods, and a transportation network struggling to keep pace with urbanization. In the face of such complexity, a new, powerful tool is emerging that could redefine Nigeria's developmental trajectory - Artificial Intelligence.",
